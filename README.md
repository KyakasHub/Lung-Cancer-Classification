# Lung-Cancer-Classification

###1.Lung cancer is a type of cancer that starts when abnormal cells grow in an uncontrolled way in the lungs. 
###2.It is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for the highest mortality rates among both men and women.
###3.Smoking of tobacco(including cigarettes, cigars, and pipes) is the leading cause of lung cancer, responsible for approximately 85% of all cases.
###4.Symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that does not go away, chest pain and shortness of breath.

###5.Lung cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages when treatment options are limited.
###6.According to the  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths in 2020.
###7.Earlier diagnosis would reduce the number of deaths and improve survival rates.
###8.This project therefore focuses on leveraging on Machine Learning techniques to predict positive Lung cancer cases.

##Observable:
###1. To determine which features strongly correlate with Lung cancer.
###2. To clearly visualize the distribution of Lung Cancer within the dataset.
##Measurable:
###1. To fit and train a classification model that can predict a positive Lung cancer case.
###2. To evaluate the Model’s accuracy using a confusion matrix.
