# Lung-Cancer-Classification

1.Lung cancer is a type of cancer that starts when abnormal cells grow in an uncontrolled way in the lungs. 

2.It is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for the highest mortality rates among both men and women.

3.Smoking of tobacco(including cigarettes, cigars, and pipes) is the leading cause of lung cancer, responsible for approximately 85% of all cases.

4.Symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that does not go away, chest pain and shortness of breath.

Problem Statement:
Lung cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages when treatment options are limited.

According to the  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths in 2020.

Earlier diagnosis would reduce the number of deaths and improve survival rates.

This project therefore focuses on leveraging on Machine Learning techniques to predict positive Lung cancer cases.

Objectives

Observable:
1. To determine which features strongly correlate with Lung cancer.
2. To clearly visualize the distribution of Lung Cancer within the dataset.
Measurable:
1. To fit and train a classification model that can predict a positive Lung cancer case.
2. To evaluate the Model’s accuracy using a confusion matrix.
